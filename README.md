# Trends-of-Severe-Weather-Events-in-the-United-States

Created interactive charts and maps in Plotly by cleaning and processing weather event data from NOAA. Analyzed the trends in economic damages and how these trends were correlated with atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. This involved challenges like writing scripts to convert deaths to economic damages using the "value of a statistical life" and adjusting the economic damages sustained in each month for inflation.

#### Note: Due to the large size of the jupyter notebook file it may take several attempts to load on github.
